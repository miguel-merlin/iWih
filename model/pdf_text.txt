The aim of the study was to determine whether a prior
diagnostic testicle biopsy can predict success or failure of
testicular sperm extraction (TESE) with intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) in patients with non-obstructive
azoospermia caused by testicular failure, and what is the
minimum threshold of sperm production in the testis which
must be surpassed for spermatozoa to reach the ejaculate.
Forty-five patients with non-obstructive azoospermia
caused by testicular failure underwent diagnostic testicle
biopsy prior to a planned future TESE-ICSI procedure.
The diagnostic testicle biopsy was analysed quantitatively,
and correlated with the quantitative findings of spermatogenesis in patients with normal spermatogenesis, as well
as with the results of subsequent attempts at TESE-ICSI.
Men with non-obstructive azoospermia caused by germinal
failure had a mean of 0-6 mature spermatids/seminiferous
tubule seen on a diagnostic testicle biopsy, compared
to 17-35 mature spermatids/tubule in men with normal
spermatogenesis and obstructive azoospermia. These findings were the same for all types of testicular failure whether
Sertoli cell only, maturation arrest, cryptorchidism, or
post-chemotherapy azoospermia. Twenty-two of 26 men
with mature spermatids found in the prior testis biopsy
had successful retrieval of spermatozoa for ICSI, 12 of
their partners became pregnant, and are either ongoing or
delivered. The study suggests that 4-6 mature spermatids/
tubule must be present in the testis biopsy for any
spermatozoa to reach the ejaculate. More than half of
azoospermic patients with germinal failure have minute
foci of spermatogenesis which are insufficient to produce
spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Prior diagnostic testicle
biopsy analysed quantitatively (for the presence of mature
spermatids) can predict subsequent success or failure with
TESE-ICSI. Incomplete testicular failure may involve a
sparse multi-focal distribution of spermatogenesis throughout the entire testicle, rather than a regional distribution.
Therefore, it is possible that massive testicular sampling
from many different regions of the testes may not be
necessary for successful TESE-ICSI.
Key words: ICSI/maturation arrest/non-obstructive azoospermia/quantitative spermatogenesis/Sertoli cell only

It was not until the availability of intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI) that this finding achieved practical clinical
application for these patients (Van Steirteghem et al, 1993;
Palermo et al, 1992). The technique (TESE-ICSI) was found
to be equally successful in azoospermia caused by either
'incomplete' maturation arrest or by 'incomplete' Sertoli cell
only (Devroey et al, 1995; Silber et al, 1996). It was noted
that in all cases of maturation arrest, the spermatogenic defect
was in meiosis, and there was no need to search for round
spermatids when performing TESE-ICSI. Wherever meiosis
was completed and round spermatids were formed, mature
spermatids and spermatozoa could also be observed.
The qualitative histology of non-obstructive azoospermia
cases undergoing TESE-ICSI has been reported to be highly
variable (Tournaye et al, 1996a, 1997). The testicular histology
was often performed at the same time as the TESE procedure
(not as a prior diagnostic biopsy), and was never analysed
quantitatively for the presence of mature spermatids using the
methods referred to earlier.
Because 60% of azoospermic cases with germ cell failure
have been found to have spermatozoa in the testis, the diagnosis
of 'Sertoli cell only' has had to be reconsidered and re-defined
in many cases (Silber et al, 1995c). The apparent absence of
spermatogenesis appears in a majority of cases to be only
a partial or incomplete defect. A better understanding of
spermatogenesis has thus led to the successful treatment of
many otherwise sterile azoospermic men with testicular failure
of a variety of causes (Clermont, 1972; Steinberger and Tjioe,
1968; Heller and Clermont, 1964; Silber, 1995; Tournaye et al,
1996b; Staessen et al, 1996).

Introduction
Testicular sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (TESE-ICSI) was first introduced in 1993 for the
treatment of obstructive azoospermia (Schoysman et al, 1993;
Devroey et al, 1994; Silber et al, 1994, 1995a). It was
soon discovered that this technique could also be used for
azoospermic men who appeared to have absent spermatogenesis, i.e. 'non-obstructive azoospermia' (Devroey et al,
1995; Silber et al, 1995b). The theoretical basis for attempting
to retrieve spermatozoa for ICSI, from the testes of men with
apparent absence of spermatogenesis, is based on a study from
1981 with quantitative analysis of spermatogenesis in testicle
biopsy specimens (Silber and Rodriguez-Rigau, 1981;
Zuckerman et al, 1978). In many cases of non-obstructive
azoospermia, an occasional spermatid was noted in the testis
biopsy despite being categorized as absent spermatogenesis.
There thus appeared to be a certain threshold of a minimum
amount of spermatogenesis necessary for spermatozoa to reach
the ejaculate (Silber et al, 1995c).

Figure 1. All patients in this study underwent a small diagnostic testicle biopsy before the relatively massive testicular sperm extraction
(TESE)-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure.
The purpose of the present study is to answer several
questions regarding spermatogenesis, and the pathology and
treatment of non-obstructive azoospermia. The first question is:
what is the maximum threshold number of mature spermatids/
tubule found in the testis biopsy, below which no spermatozoa
will appear in the ejaculate? The second question is: can
quantitative analysis of a prior routine diagnostic testicle
biopsy give any prognosis for the potential success of a
future TESE-ICSI?' Finally, what can we conclude about the
distribution of spermatids in such cases, and would this
information help in the surgical strategy for sperm retrieval
and TESE in non-obstructive azoospermia?

Materials and methods
Patient population
The patient population consisted of 45 consecutive male patients with
a finding of azoospermia who were subjected to diagnostic testicle
biopsy prior to their planned TESE-ICSI procedure (Figure 1). In all
patients, the azoospermic semen was subjected, on three separate
occasions, to centrifugation at 1800 g, with careful examination to
determine the presence of even a single spermatozoon. If any
spermatozoa at all were detected after centrifugation, these patients
were excluded from the current study and underwent a standard ICSI
procedure under the category of 'pseudo-azoospermia'. Patients were
not considered to be azoospermic if even a single spermatozoon
could be found after centrifugation at 1800 g. The absence of ductal
obstruction was verified in all patients at the time of the diagnostic
biopsy. All patients in this study then underwent, along with their
wives, a TESE-ICSI procedure as has been previously described
(Devroey et al, 1995; Silber et al, 1995a; Palermo et al, 1992). In
summary, the selection of patients for this study were those couples
suffering from non-obstructive azoospermia who underwent a TESEICSI attempt after having undergone a prior diagnostic testicle biopsy.
All categories of non-obstructive azoospermia, based on the
classical histological evaluation and clinical history, were included
in this study. These categories were complete or incomplete Sertoli
cell only, maturation arrest, cryptorchid testicular atrophy, post-

chemotherapy azoospermia, and mixed types of deficient spermatogenesis. The diagnosis of testicular failure was based on the finding
of azoospermia, the absence of obstruction, and classic pathological
interpretation of histology. Then the biopsies were subjected to a
time-consuming quantitative analysis.
Quantitative analysis of testicular biopsy
The method of quantitative analysis has already been described
(Zuckerman et al, 1978; Silber and Rodriguez-Rigau, 1981; Silber
et al, 1990). Histologic sections were prepared by excising the
seminiferous tubules with wet, sharp, Iris scissors using a no-touch
method, and allowing the specimen to fall into Zenker's solution. At
no stage was the sample handled. The specimens were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin and cut into thin sections.
At least 20 seminiferous tubules (usually more) were evaluated on
each side. All of the steps of spermatogenesis were counted, but only
the most common, pre-meiotic and post-meiotic cells, for the purpose
of this report, were tabulated, i.e., pachytene spermatocyte (premeiotic), and mature, or maturing, spermatids (slightly to completely
elongated). A biopsy showing a single, isolated tubule with a few
spermatids in a field of tubules that were otherwise strictly Sertoli
cell only was, for simplicity, defined as 'Sertoli cell only'. 'Maturation
arrest' was defined as an absence of mature spermatids despite normal
early stages of spermatogenesis. Again, the presence of a rare
spermatid in an entire slide of otherwise total maturation arrest was
defined as maturation arrest. The totals of pre-meiotic spermatocytes
(pachytene) and post-meiotic cells (spermatids) were tabulated and
expressed as the 'mean' number/seminiferous tubule. The contents
of all seminiferous tubules in the histologic section were included in
the tabulation.
If the biopsy showed normal spermatogenesis as defined by classical
methods, the patient was deemed to have obstructive azoospermia,
was thereby excluded from this study, and underwent microsurgery
to correct the obstruction combined with microsurgical epididymal
sperm aspiration (MESA). If obstruction was discovered, the patient
was not included in this study, which is limited to pathology and
treatment of non-obstructive azoospermia.
Technique of diagnostic testicle biopsy
The technique for diagnostic testicle biopsy was very simple compared
to that used for TESE-ICSI. For diagnostic testicle biopsy, the

TESE-ICSI procedure
The technique for TESE-ICSI in these cases of non-obstructive
azoospermia was more extensive than in cases of obstruction, and
has previously been described in great detail (Silber et al, 1996). A
2 cm horizontal incision was made in the scrotal skin and carried
through the peritoneal tunica vaginalis, and then small incisions were
made through the tunica albuginea in different regions of the testis.
A small piece of extruding testicular tissue was excised and placed
in a Petri dish with 3 ml HEPES-buffered media. After each biopsy,
the tunica albuginea was closed with 3-0 vicryl stitches and the tissue
was prepared and examined in the IVF laboratory before any
subsequent biopsies were made in other areas of the testicle or
testicles. If no spermatozoa were found after an initial search, then
another biopsy was performed. The extensive search for spermatozoa
in the ICSI lab would take too long for the patient to remain in the
operating room waiting for a decision as to whether another TESE
biopsy should be obtained from a different region of the testis.
Therefore, if no spermatozoa were seen initially (before concentration
in multiple 5 \xl droplets), further biopsies were taken. This is the
standard approach we have used from the beginning for such cases.
Often 4-8 biopsies were obtained if deemed necessary.
The testicular tissue was minced finally in HEPES-buffered media
and, after initial inspection in the IVF lab, placed in a 5 ml falcon
tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 g. The supernatant was removed
and the pellet resuspended in 50 ul of medium. For very difficult
cases, the testicular suspension was incubated in red blood cell lysing
buffer, and then washed again with HEPES-buffered medium (Ogura
and Yanigamachi, 1993). All of the testicular suspension was examined
completely by dividing it into multiple microdroplets in the ICSI
injection dish with a volume of 5 ul/droplet. In this manner, the
entire effluent obtained by mincing testicular tissue was examined in
toto over the course of many hours, in an attempt to retrieve
spermatozoa for ICSI. The ICSI procedure was then performed in
the manner which has already been described in great detail (Silber
et al, 1996).

Results
Threshold of spermatogenesis for spermatozoa to reach the
ejaculate
Tables I, II, and III summarize the results of the quantitative
tabulation of pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids found
in the seminiferous tubules on histologic examination of
the patients with Sertoli cell only, with maturation arrest,
and with mixed causes of non-obstructive azoospermia. In
2424

previous studies it has been demonstrated that with
obstruction and normal spermatogenesis, the mean number
of mature spermatids/tubule ranges from 17.4-31.4 (Silber
and Rodriguez-Rigau, 1981; Silber et al, 1990). Wherever
spermatids are present, a similar number of spermatocytes are
also found. As can be seen from Table I, in patients with the
classic histologic diagnosis of Sertoli cell only, nine out of 23
(39%) were found to have a very small number of spermatids
present (0.5-6.4 spermatids/seminiferous tubule) and thus
were, in a sense, incomplete Sertoli cell only. This tiny focus
of spermatogenesis in 39% of men who otherwise had classic
Sertoli cell only is dramatically less than the number of
spermatids seen in men with obstructive azoospermia who are
presumed to have normal spermatogenesis (Figure 2).
A similar finding is noted in Table II in the number of
spermatids seen in the histology of men with azoospermia
caused by maturation arrest. In this case, there is a mean of
0.4 spermatids/tubule to 5.6 spermatids/tubule seen in 10
of the 12 cases, and no spermatids whatsoever seen in two of
the 12 cases. Again, this represents a dramatic decrease in the
presence of spermatids compared to that seen in men with
obstructive azoospermia and presumably normal spermatogenesis. Table III demonstrates the same phenomenon in
cases of miscellaneous non-obstructive azoospermia including
cryptorchidism and post-chemotherapy azoospermia, with
anywhere from 0 spermatids/tubule to a maximum of 6.6
spermatids/tubule.
In the vast majority of these 45 cases of non-obstructive
azoospermia, < 4 mature spermatids/tubule were noted in the
quantitative histological analysis, and in none of these 45
patients with non-obstructive azoospermia was there >6.5
mature spermatids/tubule noted. This represents a 6-30-fold
reduction in the number of mature spermatids/tubule seen in
the two-dimensional histologic section from men with nonobstructive azoospermia compared to men with normal spermatogenesis.
As was explained in 1981, the quantitation of spermatids/
seminiferous tubule on histologic section represents a twodimensional evaluation, whereas the amount of spermatozoa
in the ejaculate relates to the three-dimensional testicular
volume. Therefore, the correlation between spermatogenesis
seen on the two-dimensional histological slide and the number
of spermatozoa to reach the ejaculate is exponential.
Therefore the testicular histology does not have to be
absolute zero in order for no spermatozoa to reach the ejaculate.
Rather, a threshold of approximately 4-6 mature spermatids/
tubule must be exceeded for any spermatozoa to reach the
ejaculate.
Comparison of quantitative evaluation of histology in a
diagnostic testicle biopsy and the successful retrieval of
spermatozoa for TESE-ICSI
Of the 45 patients included in this study, 26 (58%) had
detectable spermatids present in the diagnostic biopsy performed prior to the attempt at TESE-ICSI. Of those 26 patients
with spermatids present in the prior biopsy, 22 (85%) had a
successful TESE-ICSI procedure performed later. Of those 22
patients in whom spermatozoa could be retrieved and used to

spermatic cord was injected with 5 ml of 0.5% local anaesthetic via
a 27 gauge needle just distal to the external inguinal ring. Then an
additional 2 ml of 0.5% local anaesthetic was injected over the
anterior scrotal skin in the area where a 0.5 cm incision was made
all the way into the tunica albuginea. This is a fairly painless clinic
procedure from which the patients are recovered within 15-20 min.
Although the procedure is no more painful than a needle biopsy, it
always yields a sufficient number of seminiferous tubules to perform
an adequate quantitative analysis.
The technique used for TESE-ICSI, however, involved a larger
incision, usually a general anaesthetic, and an extensive exposure of
the surface of the tunica albuginea in order to obtain samples from
all regions of the testis. Thus, a prior testicle biopsy was a very
minimal procedure compared to the extensive procedure employed
for TESE-ICSI.

pregnancy. Of the 19 patients without any spermatids seen on
an exhaustive quantitative evaluation of the prior biopsy,
only one had a successful TESE-ICSI procedure (defined by
retrieving spermatozoa which were used successfully to fertilize
their wife's oocytes), but none became pregnant. Thus, a prior
positive testicle biopsy yielded an 85% chance for successful
TESE-ICSI, and a negative prior testicle biopsy reduced the
possibility for successful TESE-ICSI to only 5%.

Comparison ofSertoli cell only, maturation arrest, and other
miscellaneous causes of non-obstructive azoospermia
With azoospermia caused by Sertoli cell only, as noted in
Table I, the mean number of pachytene spermatocytes is
roughly equivalent to the mean number of spermatids/seminiferous tubule. This one-to-one relationship is the same as is
seen in normal spermatogenesis (Silber et al, 1990). However,
in Table II, it is observed that with azoospermia caused by
maturation arrest, there is a normal number of pachytene

Figure 2. (a) Sertoli cell only, (b) normal spermatogenesis.
spermatocytes counted per seminiferous tubule despite either
zero or a drastically reduced number of spermatids/seminiferous tubule (Figure 3). In the miscellaneous categories of nonobstructive azoospermia, there were a variable number of
pachytene spermatocytes despite a consistently reduced number
of spermatids.
2426

Peculiarly, with Sertoli cell only, the presence of any
spermatids in the prior biopsy uniformly predicted that TESEICSI would be successful. However, with maturation arrest,
the finding of spermatids in a prior biopsy was no guarantee
of successful retrieval of spermatozoa for TESE-ICSI. Nine
out of nine Sertoli cell only cases with spermatids seen at
prior histology had successful ICSI sperm retrieval, but only
six out of 10 cases of maturation arrest with spermatids seen
at prior histology had a successful retrieval of spermatozoa
at TESE-ICSI. Furthermore, the histology of patients with
maturation arrest usually revealed only 2 0 ^ 0 cross-sections
of tubules for counting, whereas in Sertoli cell only cases,
there were generally more than 100 tubule cross-sections. This
is readily explained by the diminished diameter of seminiferous
tubules with Sertoli cell only compared to the completely
normal diameter of seminiferous tubules in patients with
maturation arrest. As has been noted previously, this phenomenon explains the normal size of testes with maturation arrest,
and the generally normal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
concentration in those cases (Silber et al, 1996).

Discussion
The rationale for treating azoospermia caused by germinal
failure with TESE and ICSI is based on the consistent
observation that in a little over 50% of such patients, a
miniscule number of spermatozoa can be extracted from
testicular tissue and that this tiny number of often non-motile
testicular spermatozoa can be successfully used with the ICSI
procedure to achieve fertilization and pregnancy. The present
study appears to indicate that there is indeed a minimum
quantitative threshold of spermatogenesis which must be
exceeded for any spermatozoa to reach the ejaculate. In all
cases of non-obstructive azoospermia subjected to a detailed
quantitative study there appears to be a mean of <6 mature
spermatids/tubule (usually <4). Most likely, when the mean
number of mature spermatids/seminiferous tubule (i.e. all of
the spermatids found on the slide divided by all of the number
of tubules) is <4-6, there is a quantity of spermatozoa
insufficient to reach the ejaculate after transit from the testicle.
The normal range of spermatogenesis in fertile men, or in
obstructive azoospermia, appears to be from 17 spermatids/
seminiferous tubule to about 35 spermatids/seminiferous tubule
(Silber et al, 1990; Silber and Rodriguez-Rigau, 1981).
Because of the exponential effect of the sperm count in the
ejaculate being a function of seminiferous tubule volume, and
the quantitative analysis histology being a two-dimensional
measurement, the curve expressing the relationship between
mean number of spermatids/seminiferous tubule, and sperm
count in the ejaculate, is an exponential one which 'breaks' at
around 15 spermatids/tubule (Figure 4). Therefore a 6-30-fold
decrease in the quantitative production of spermatozoa seen
on a two-dimensional seminiferous tubule cross-section can
result in as much as a thousand-fold or greater difference in
actual sperm production. Thus, the presence of only a few
mature spermatids/tubule in germinal failure and nonobstructive azoospermia cases represents an extremely deficient
degree of sperm production. It is apparent that an extremely
low quantity of sperm production is compatible with azoospermia and that a threshold of probably 4-6 mature spermatids/
tubule must be exceeded for any spermatozoa to reach the
ejaculate.

Figure 5. The reliability of prior diagnostic biopsy suggests a
homogeneous distribution of spermatogenesis in non-obstructive
azoospermia, and not a patchy distribution.

The findings were similar for cases of Sertoli cell only,
maturation arrest, cryptorchidism, post-chemotherapy, and even
combinations of maturation arrest and Sertoli cell only. Thus,
the type of germinal failure, or the cause of the non-obstructive
azoospermia, had no effect on this threshold concept. In fact,
the same threshold principle seems to apply equally for all
types of germinal failure and non-obstructive azoospermia
whatever the cause.
How can a small diagnostic testicle biopsy specimen
representing perhaps 1/1000 of the total testicular volume
possibly predict the presence of a minute patch of spermatogenesis to be found somewhere in the testicle at a future date
during a TESE-ICSI procedure? The fear is that either the
diagnostic biopsy could miss the one area where spermatogenesis was occurring, or alternatively, if the diagnostic biopsy
was lucky enough to hit the one area of spermatogenesis, then
perhaps it could be removed with that diagnostic biopsy. The
findings of our present study suggest that these are not serious
problems because the distribution of a minute quantity of
spermatogenesis in these germinal failure patients must be
diffusely multi-focal, distributed evenly throughout the testicle
rather than in a few patchy areas (Figure 5). The fact that a
single diagnostic testicle biopsy is relatively predictive of
successful retrieval of spermatozoa at TESE, and in fact of
multiple TESE-ICSI procedures in the same patient, argues
for a distribution of spermatogenesis in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia that is multi-focal and relatively
homogeneous throughout the testicle.
This homogeneous distribution within the testis has been
well established in normal spermatogenesis since the early work
of Steinberger, who found that the quantitative determination of
the various elements of spermatogenesis determined by a
single diagnostic testicle biopsy is representative of what would
be found if the entire testicle were removed, homogenized, and
counted in toto (Steinberger and Tjioe, 1968). If the presence
of a minute amount of spermatogenesis in these deficient
testicles was of a regional nature, dispersed unevenly in
perhaps one or two different areas, rather than sprinkled like
pepper throughout the testicle, then a diagnostic testicle biopsy
would not be predictive of the potential success or failure of
TESE-ICSI. The fact that a diagnostic biopsy is predictive of

success with TESE supports Steinberger's original concept
from 1968.
Comparison of the findings in maturation arrest and
Sertoli cell only is also of interest. In maturation arrest cases,
we found a completely normal distribution of 17.1-33.5
pachytene spermatocytes/seminiferous tubule. This is no different from the number of pre-meiotic cells that would be
seen in patients with obstructive azoospermia and normal
spermatogenesis. Nonetheless, in maturation arrest, there were
either no spermatids, or a very tiny number of spermatids (up
to a maximum of 6/tubule), just as in Sertoli cell only. Thus,
the maturation arrest cases we have seen do not reflect a
failure of the maturing of spermatids. Rather, maturation arrest
in our series represented a failure of the spermatocytes to
undergo meiosis. Furthermore, like 'Sertoli cell only,' it is not
necessarily a 100% defect. In the majority of cases of maturation arrest, there are nonetheless a tiny number of pachytene
spermatocytes that complete meiosis into spermatids which
are capable of developing into normal children after TESEICSI. Finally, it needs to be emphasized that in none of the
cases of maturation arrest did we find round spermatids in the
absence of elongated spermatids, or mature spermatozoa.
In summary, there is a threshold of spermatogenesis which
must be exceeded for any spermatozoa at all to reach the
ejaculate. Quantitative analysis of testicle biopsy is able to
predict the likelihood of success or failure of TESE-ICSI.
Extremely tiny numbers of spermatozoa extracted from a
testicle biopsy in azoospermic men appear to yield pregnancy
rates using ICSI no lower than those achieved in men with
normal spermatogenesis. Finally, prior diagnostic testicle
biopsy is recommended for all patients with azoospermia from
any cause in order to plan appropriate treatment. Rather than
representing an unnecessary extra procedure, this knowledge
may prevent the needless removal of excessive tissue from all
regions of the testis when attempting TESE-ICSI. If the prior
testicle biopsy, evaluated quantitatively, reveals no spermatids,
then the couple should be counselled about the possibility of
donor sperm back-up.
